**Architecture and Data Flow**
# Architecture
## The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

Models: Define the data structure and interact with the database.
Controllers: Handle the business logic and process incoming requests.
Routes: Define the endpoints and map them to the corresponding controller methods.
Middleware: Handle authentication, authorization, and other pre-processing tasks.

# Data Flow
1. Client Request: The client sends a request to the server (e.g., to place a trade).
2. Route Handling: The request is routed to the appropriate controller method 3.based on the endpoint.
3. Controller Logic: The controller processes the request, interacts with the models, and performs the necessary business logic.
4. Database Interaction: The models interact with the MongoDB database to fetch or store data.
5. Response: The controller sends a response back to the client with the requested data or confirmation of the action performed.

**Challenges and Solutions**

# Challenge 1: Real-time Updates
Problem: Ensuring that all clients receive real-time updates for events and trades.

Solution: Implemented Socket.io to handle real-time communication between the server and clients. This allows the server to broadcast updates to all connected clients whenever there is a change in events or trades.

# Challenge 2: Role-based Access Control
Problem: Restricting certain actions (e.g., creating events, settling trades) to admin users only.

Solution: Implemented role-based access control using middleware. The middleware checks the user's role before allowing access to specific endpoints.

# Challenge 3: Data Consistency
Problem: Ensuring data consistency when multiple clients are interacting with the same data (e.g., placing trades on the same event).

Solution: Used Mongoose transactions to ensure atomic operations and maintain data consistency. This ensures that all related operations are completed successfully or none at all.
